# CreditCard-fraud-detection-using-Supervised-Machine-Learning

Fraud in credit card transactions is a growing concern for both consumers and financial institutions. Fraud detection in credit card transactions is a crucial
problem in the financial industry. With the increasing use of credit cards for online transactions, developing efficient and accurate methods to detect and prevent fraud is becoming more important.

We assess the effectiveness of four popular machine learning models—Random Forest,Logistic regression, Decision trees, and XGBoost—in this research at identifying and forecasting fictitious or counterfeit credit card processing transactions.

The XGBoost model along with Hyperparameter tuning gave the best result with an accuracy of 99.88 percent.
